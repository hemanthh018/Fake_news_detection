In June, Iran fired missiles into eastern Syria, targeting bases of Islamic State which had claimed responsibility for attacks in Tehran which killed 18 people. The Revolutionary Guards are fighting in Syria against militant groups which oppose President Bashar al-Assad. \",\n          \"SEOUL (Reuters) - Two U.S. B-1B heavy bombers joined large-scale combat drills over South Korea on Thursday amid warnings from North Korea that the exercises and U.S. threats have made the outbreak of war  an established fact.  The annual U.S.-South Korean  Vigilant Ace  exercises feature 230 aircraft, including some of the most advanced U.S. stealth warplanes, and come a week after North Korea tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to date, which it says can reach all of the United States. North Korea s foreign ministry blamed the drills and  confrontational warmongering  by U.S. officials for making war inevitable.  The remaining question now is: when will the war break out?  it said in a statement.  We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it.  China, North Korea s neighbor and lone major ally, again urged calm and said war was not the answer, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said North Korea wanted direct talks with the United States to seek guarantees on its security, something Moscow was ready to facilitate.  We hope all relevant parties can maintain calm and restraint and take steps to alleviate tensions and not provoke each other,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.  The outbreak of war is not in any side s interest. The ones that will suffer the most are ordinary people.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of a conference in Vienna that U.S. military exercises and aggressive rhetoric were causing an unacceptable escalation in tension. Lavrov said he had passed on to Tillerson Pyongyang s desire for direct talks.  We know that North Korea wants above all to talk to the United States about guarantees for its security. We are ready to support that, we are ready to take part in facilitating such negotiations,  Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said direct talks with North Korea were  not on the table until they are willing to denuclearize.   It is something that Russia says it agrees with; it is something China has said it agrees with, and many other nations around the world as well,  she told a regular briefing. Nauert said North Korea was  not showing any interest in sitting down and having any kind of serious conversations when they continue to fire off ballistic missiles.  Another State Department spokesperson, Justin Higgins, said it was not enough for North Korea to freeze its nuclear program, and it  must be prepared to come to the table ready to chart a course to  cease and roll back  that program.    China s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zheng Zeguang was to meet Matt Pottinger, the head of Asian affairs at the    White House s National Security Council, on Thursday to discuss North Korea and trade, a senior U.S. official said. Tensions have risen markedly in recent months over North Korea s development, in defiance of repeated rounds of U.N. sanctions, of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States. Last week s missile test prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea s leadership would be  utterly destroyed  if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests. In September, after North Korea s sixth and largest nuclear test, B-1Bs flew further north along North Korea s coast than at any time in the past 17 years. The sortie prompted Pyongyang s foreign minister to warn that U.S. bombers could be shot down even if they did not enter North Korean airspace. Yang Uk, a senior fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum, said B-1Bs would be key to any strike targeting major North Korean facilities.  B-1B bombers have been regularly dispatched to the Korean peninsula over the past years; however, it seems that the U.S. Air Force might have enhanced its training to better prepare for actual warfare,  he said. Both sides insist they don t want war, while saying they will act to defend themselves. U.S. national security adviser H.R. McMaster said at the weekend the possibility of war was  increasing every day.  He said Trump was prepared to take action against North Korea but was working to convince China, Russia and others to do more to press Pyongyang to get it to give up its weapons programs. U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged the Pentagon on Sunday to start moving U.S. military dependants out of South Korea, saying conflict with North Korea was getting close. The Pentagon said it has  no intent  to move out any dependants. On Wednesday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,  Nikki Haley, raised doubts about U.S. participation in the  Olympic Winter Games in South Korea in February, telling Fox News that Washington was concerned about its citizens. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Thursday the United States looked forward to participating in the games and was engaged with South Korea and other nations to secure the venues. North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. The rising tensions coincide with a rare visit to North Korea by United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2012. Some analysts and diplomats hope his visit could spark a U.N.-led effort to defuse tensions. Feltman met North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho on Thursday, North Korea s official KCNA news agency said. \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain asked President Donald Trump on Thursday to help Ukraine defend itself against an increase in recent attacks from Russia. \\u201cIn light of the latest Russian attacks and the prospect of future aggression against Ukraine, I urge you to exercise the authority given to you by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 to provide defensive lethal assistance to Ukraine to defend its territory against further violations by Russia and its separatist proxies,\\u201d McCain said in a letter. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 716,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"September 2, 2017 \",\n          \"February 2, 2017 \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_fake.head(5)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"id":"7bHhy6rqx1B9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719392517257,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1294,"user":{"displayName":"Hemanth Hemanth","userId":"16870685831745505131"}},"outputId":"e8b0bd34-6e22-4b87-de12-acbbf78f954c"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0   Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Year’...   \n","1   Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian ...   \n","2   Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke...   \n","3   Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obama’s Name...   \n","4   Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump Dur...   \n","\n","                                                text subject  \\\n","0  Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans ...

According to the Clinical Trials website, run by the National Institutes of Health, participants must be at least 14 years old and 18-24 weeks pregnant.The controversial study, led by Bliss Kaneshiro, MD and Kate Whitehouse, DO, will monitor bleeding during D&E abortions to determine the effects of the drug oxytocin, commonly used to minimize blood loss and decrease the risk of hemorrhage.The clinical trial, called  Effects of Oxytocin on Bleeding Outcomes during Dilation and Evacuation  began in October 2014 and is a collaboration between UH, Society of Family Planning and the University of Washington.The Society of Family Planning funds a number of similar research projects, such as experimenting with the dosage of Misoprostol, a uterine contracting agent, prior to surgical abortions at 13-18 weeks and exploring umbilical cord injections to produce fetal death prior to late-term abortions.In the UH study, researchers will carry out a  randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials,  to determine the effect of oxytocin s use on uterine bleeding, meaning that they will either provide or deny intravenous oxytocin to the women.Reports suggest that some doctors are concerned that withholding oxytocin during surgery may put patients, especially teen girls, at risk. This study is reminiscent of Nazi concentration camp experiments. I pity the poor women who are being treated like lab rats, especially those who are denied the drug to reduce hemorrhaging,  said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.Dilation and evacuation abortions are surgical procedures that involve dismembering the pre-born baby with forceps, scraping the inside of the uterus with a curette to remove any residuals and finally suctioning out the womb to make sure the contents are completely removed.After the abortion, the corpse of the fetus is reassembled and examined to ensure everything was successfully removed and that the abortion was complete.The study is hoping to attract up to 166 test subjects and is expected to conclude in July 2015.Via: Breitbart News\",\n          \"CNN was quick to scoop up Corey Lewandowski after Donald Trump kicked him out of his role as campaign manager, but his first week on the job is going pretty much exactly how you would expect it to go   terribly.Not only has Lewandowski proven himself to be pretty much like a paid spokesman for Trump, but his defense of the disgraced GOP candidate isn t being received well. Earlier this week, Lewandowski revealed that he was under contract and couldn t criticize The Donald, even after being fired from the campaign. Today, Lewandowski got called out by Hillary Clinton surrogate Christine Quinn for hyping Trump up to be an expert on the Brexit decision   a suggestion that was clearly false.On Monday s edition of CNN s New Day, Lewandowski made another pathetic defense of Trump by trying to reframe the candidate s disgusting reaction to Brexit, where he mostly spoke about how much the decision would be good for his Scotland golf resort. Lewandowski s defense was: Obviously the U.S. dollar has become much stronger now against the British pound. If you re going to spend money in Europe, now would actually be a good time to go with the fall of the pound.What you have is a world view, so what you have is someone who is saying,  Let s look at this from the U.S. perspective. If you want to go and travel overseas   just from a monetary perspective   now is the right time to do that because what you re getting is more for your dollar. Quinn wasn t having it. She ripped into Lewandowski, firing back, Donald Trump is not running to be travel agent of the world, he s running to be president of the United States.  She continued: What he said wasn t a commentary on international markets, it was,  When the pound goes down, more people will come to my golf course. Donald Trump s main concern isn t the international markets, it isn t the impact that Brexit will have on hard working Americans  401Ks, it s himself. How can he make more money, how can he put more money in his bank account? Lewandowski compared the Brexit decision to Trump s rise in the GOP, and Quinn once again called him out and put him back in his place. She said: Trump touted that he saw this coming. That s ridiculous because when he was first asked about Brexit by the press, he didn t appear to know what it was. Lewandowski tried to counter by insisting that People are too smart, they are tired of being told what to do.  He then tried to commend Trump for being a selfish moron: You know what Donald Trump said about Brexit? What he said was, you don t have to listen to me because it s not my decision. He didn t weigh in like Hillary Clinton did, like Barack Obama did, saying that you can t do this. Quinn fought back, Because he didn t know what it was. Lewandowski was fighting a losing battle. Trump s reaction to Brexit was just as terrifying as it was humorous   it truly proved that Trump knows nothing about foreign affairs, and hasn t spent any time educating himself since the beginning of his presidential candidacy. If only some of the hours he spent getting into fights on Twitter were being used for learning about how the world works. But instead, he once again exposed himself as an unfit choice for President. And when people like Lewandowski try to make sense of his idiocy, they only make themselves look equally foolish.You can watch the embarrassing video below:Featured image via screen capture\",\n          \"A Michigan woman decided to defend against tyranny? when she and another shopper couldn t agree over who got to buy the last notebook on the shelf at the Novi Towne Center store.According to ABC 13, the brawl   yes, brawl    involved two Farmington Hills residents, ages 46 and 32, and a mother and daughter from South Lyon, ages 51 and 20. In other words, these were all grown adults who should have known better but hey   there was only one notebook on the shelf, and we ve all seen what happens in those post-apocalyptic movies when a store is down to the last gallon of milk, right?Two of the women, one of whom was the unnamed 20-year-old, reached for the notebook at the same time. The 46 and 32-year-olds apparently decided that she wasn t getting their goddamn notebook and began pulling her hair.Then, because this had almost hit peak  trailer park,  the 20-year-old s mother decided to go for bonus points by pulling out her gun. Fortunately, someone pushed her aside before she could do any harm.This is one of the NRA s  responsible gun owners  (conservatives can t dismiss this one, as it is confirmed that she is a concealed carry permit holder)   ready to leap into action at the most minor sign of danger and make things worse by turning the situation potentially deadly.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"politics\",\n          \"Middle-east\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1681,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Jun 5, 2015\",\n          \"August 28, 2016\",\n          \"June 3, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8p9W2l6wx8Kb","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719392531638,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":509,"user":{"displayName":"Hemanth Hemanth","userId":"16870685831745505131"}},"outputId":"938277ae-e01f-4daa-8cf8-6f1aba755c25"},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["((21417, 4), (23481, 4))"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":6}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_true['class']=0\n","data_fake['class']=1"],"metadata":{"id":"4_FawBDbx__-","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719392544566,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":508,"user":{"displayName":"Hemanth Hemanth","userId":"16870685831745505131"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_true_manual_testing = data_true.tail(10)\n","for i in range(21416,21406,-1):\n","  data_true.drop([i],axis=0,inplace=True)\n","\n","data_fake_manual_testing = data_fake.tail(10)\n","for i in range(21416,21406,-1):\n","  data_fake.drop([i],axis=0,inplace=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"_BPYECf6yDZj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719392705098,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":484,"user":{"displayName":"Hemanth Hemanth","userId":"16870685831745505131"}}},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_manual_testing = pd.concat([data_fake_manual_testing,data_true_manual_testing],axis=0)\n","data_manual_testing.to_csv('manual_testing.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"b1virhY1yqVO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719392850055,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":571,"user":{"displayName":"Hemanth Hemanth","userId":"16870685831745505131"}}},"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["data_merge = pd.concat([data_true,data_fake],axis=0)\n","data_merge.head(10)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":363},"id":"13eUWwZLzNow","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1719392893895,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1097,"user":{"displayName":"Hemanth Hemanth","userId":"16870685831745505131"}},"outputId":"af76c04e-02d6-4be6-9d89-6b029b4c5271"},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               title  \\\n","0  As U.S. budget fight looms, Republicans flip t...   \n","1  U.S. military to accept transgender recruits o...   \n","2  Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Muell...   \n","3  FBI Russia probe helped by Australian diplomat...   \n","4  Trump wants Postal Service to charge 'much mor...   \n","5  White House, Congress prepare for talks on spe...   \n","6  Trump says Russia probe will be fair, but time...   \n","7  Factbox: Trump on Twitter (Dec 29) -

China s armed forces, the world s largest, are ramping up their capabilities with new equipment like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters as the country pursues a more assertive stance in the disputed East and South China Seas and seeks to project power far from home shores. In a brief story on its website about a military technology exhibition in Beijing, the Defence Ministry named Li Shangfu as the new head of the military s Equipment Development Department. It gave no other details of his appointment. According to his official resume, Li was previously director of one of China s main satellite launch sites in Xichang in the southwestern province of Sichuan and has been involved in missions to explore the moon. The U.S. Defense Department has highlighted China s increasing space capabilities, saying it was pursuing activities aimed at preventing other nations from using space-based assets in a crisis. China insists it has only peaceful ambitions in space, but has tested anti-satellite missiles. Li, 59, takes over from Zhang Youxia, who has likely reached retirement age. Li could be promoted to Zhang s position on the Central Military Commission, which is in overall charge of the People s Liberation Army, when the party holds its once-in-five-years congress in Beijing next month. However, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that the commission may be cut down to Xi and four vice-chairmen, doing away with committee members and streamlining reporting lines. President Xi Jinping, who is commander-in-chief of China s armed forces, currently chairs the commission, which also comprises two vice-chairmen and eight committee members. China s military is preparing a sweeping leadership reshuffle, dropping top generals, including two that sources say are under investigation for corruption. China earlier this month also appointed new commanders for its army and air force.  \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday was scheduled to interview two candidates to replace James Comey as head of the FBI, former agency No. 2 James Pistole and former Assistant Attorney General Chris Wray, the White House said. The interviews mark a re-start of sorts for the search to find someone to replace Comey, who Trump fired on May 9. Trump said earlier this month he was \\u201cvery close\\u201d to picking a nominee for the post and he had already met with several candidates. \\u201cThe president will be meeting with two additional candidates this afternoon, both Chris Wray and John Pistole,\\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters. \\u201cWhen the president feels as though he\\u2019s met with the right candidate he\\u2019ll let us know.\\u201d Pistole, the former head of the Transportation Security Administration, served as deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2004 to 2010. USA Today was first to report that Trump would be meeting with Pistole. Wray served as assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division from 2003 to 2005. Comey was leading an FBI probe into possible collusion between Trump\\u2019s campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election. His dismissal prompted an outcry from Democrats and some Republican lawmakers and raised questions about whether the president was trying to interfere with the investigation.  The week after Comey was fired, reports emerged that Trump had asked Comey to end the agency\\u2019s investigation into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia, according to a source who has seen a memo of the conversation written by Comey. The Department of Justice appointed a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller, to head an independent investigation of the Russia matter. \",\n          \"They whined and fear mongered, but in the end, Republicans had to sit and watch as Oregon took action to help struggling workers make a fair living.On Wednesday, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed a bill into law raising the state minimum wage to the highest in the country, but in a unique way that takes into consideration the differences between urban and rural business growth.According to The Oregonian:The bill gives Oregon the highest statewide minimum wage rates in the nation, to $14.75 inside Portland s urban growth boundary, $13.50 in midsize counties and $12.50 in rural areas by 2022.The law was agreed upon by labor unions and businesses in a compromise that should stand as proof that both sides can work together for the common good of the hardworking people who are trying to feed and cloth their families.Governor Brown expressed pride at what Oregon Democrats have achieved for families across the state with the help of unions and businesses. I am extremely proud of the collaborative spirit of the stakeholder groups that worked to develop this legislation. Oregon has not only avoided a number of potentially problematic ballot measures, we have taken a very smart approach in a way that makes sense for workers and for businesses no matter where in Oregon they are. On Facebook, Brown wrote that the new law will  ensure hard-working Oregonians get a much-needed raise in order to keep up with rising costs of rent, food, and other necessities. Even President Obama praised the new wage hike in a statement via the White House, and called upon Congress to do the same for the rest of the nation.I commend the Oregon Legislature and Governor Kate Brown for taking action to raise their state s minimum wage. Since I first called on Congress to increase the federal minimum wage in 2013, 18 states and the District of Columbia have acted on their own. These efforts will boost the paychecks of hardworking Americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet. Today, more than half of our states guarantee their workers a wage higher than the federal minimum. That s progress. But Congress needs to keep up with the rest of the country. They need to act, and finally give America a raise. And until they do, I ll continue to encourage states, cities, counties and companies to act on their own to support hardworking families.This is a great day for Oregon workers, who must be a little more excited than usual to go to work now that they know they ll be taking home much more needed income to provide for themselves and their families.The same cannot be said for most of Republican-controlled Alabama and other red states. Republicans there recently passed a law banning counties and cities from increasing the minimum wage within their own boundaries, making clear that they have no intention of raising the minimum wage in that state for the foreseeable future.So while people in Oregon can have hope that the future will be financially brighter, people in Alabama are struck and that s why it doesn t make sense for people to vote for Republicans.

China s armed forces, the world s largest, are ramping up their capabilities with new equipment like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters as the country pursues a more assertive stance in the disputed East and South China Seas and seeks to project power far from home shores. In a brief story on its website about a military technology exhibition in Beijing, the Defence Ministry named Li Shangfu as the new head of the military s Equipment Development Department. It gave no other details of his appointment. According to his official resume, Li was previously director of one of China s main satellite launch sites in Xichang in the southwestern province of Sichuan and has been involved in missions to explore the moon. The U.S. Defense Department has highlighted China s increasing space capabilities, saying it was pursuing activities aimed at preventing other nations from using space-based assets in a crisis. China insists it has only peaceful ambitions in space, but has tested anti-satellite missiles. Li, 59, takes over from Zhang Youxia, who has likely reached retirement age. Li could be promoted to Zhang s position on the Central Military Commission, which is in overall charge of the People s Liberation Army, when the party holds its once-in-five-years congress in Beijing next month. However, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that the commission may be cut down to Xi and four vice-chairmen, doing away with committee members and streamlining reporting lines. President Xi Jinping, who is commander-in-chief of China s armed forces, currently chairs the commission, which also comprises two vice-chairmen and eight committee members. China s military is preparing a sweeping leadership reshuffle, dropping top generals, including two that sources say are under investigation for corruption. China earlier this month also appointed new commanders for its army and air force.  \",\n          \"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday was scheduled to interview two candidates to replace James Comey as head of the FBI, former agency No. 2 James Pistole and former Assistant Attorney General Chris Wray, the White House said. The interviews mark a re-start of sorts for the search to find someone to replace Comey, who Trump fired on May 9. Trump said earlier this month he was \\u201cvery close\\u201d to picking a nominee for the post and he had already met with several candidates. \\u201cThe president will be meeting with two additional candidates this afternoon, both Chris Wray and John Pistole,\\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters. \\u201cWhen the president feels as though he\\u2019s met with the right candidate he\\u2019ll let us know.\\u201d Pistole, the former head of the Transportation Security Administration, served as deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 2004 to 2010. USA Today was first to report that Trump would be meeting with Pistole. Wray served as assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department\\u2019s Criminal Division from 2003 to 2005. Comey was leading an FBI probe into possible collusion between Trump\\u2019s campaign and Russia to sway the 2016 presidential election. His dismissal prompted an outcry from Democrats and some Republican lawmakers and raised questions about whether the president was trying to interfere with the investigation.  The week after Comey was fired, reports emerged that Trump had asked Comey to end the agency\\u2019s investigation into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia, according to a source who has seen a memo of the conversation written by Comey. The Department of Justice appointed a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller, to head an independent investigation of the Russia matter. \",\n          \"They whined and fear mongered, but in the end, Republicans had to sit and watch as Oregon took action to help struggling workers make a fair living.On Wednesday, Oregon Governor Kate Brown signed a bill into law raising the state minimum wage to the highest in the country, but in a unique way that takes into consideration the differences between urban and rural business growth.According to The Oregonian:The bill gives Oregon the highest statewide minimum wage rates in the nation, to $14.75 inside Portland s urban growth boundary, $13.50 in midsize counties and $12.50 in rural areas by 2022.The law was agreed upon by labor unions and businesses in a compromise that should stand as proof that both sides can work together for the common good of the hardworking people who are trying to feed and cloth their families.Governor Brown expressed pride at what Oregon Democrats have achieved for families across the state with the help of unions and businesses. I am extremely proud of the collaborative spirit of the stakeholder groups that worked to develop this legislation. Oregon has not only avoided a number of potentially problematic ballot measures, we have taken a very smart approach in a way that makes sense for workers and for businesses no matter where in Oregon they are. On Facebook, Brown wrote that the new law will  ensure hard-working Oregonians get a much-needed raise in order to keep up with rising costs of rent, food, and other necessities. Even President Obama praised the new wage hike in a statement via the White House, and called upon Congress to do the same for the rest of the nation.I commend the Oregon Legislature and Governor Kate Brown for taking action to raise their state s minimum wage. Since I first called on Congress to increase the federal minimum wage in 2013, 18 states and the District of Columbia have acted on their own. These efforts will boost the paychecks of hardworking Americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet. Today, more than half of our states guarantee their workers a wage higher than the federal minimum. That s progress. But Congress needs to keep up with the rest of the country. They need to act, and finally give America a raise. And until they do, I ll continue to encourage states, cities, counties and companies to act on their own to support hardworking families.This is a great day for Oregon workers, who must be a little more excited than usual to go to work now that they know they ll be taking home much more needed income to provide for themselves and their families.The same cannot be said for most of Republican-controlled Alabama and other red states. Republicans there recently passed a law banning counties and cities from increasing the minimum wage within their own boundaries, making clear that they have no intention of raising the minimum wage in that state for the foreseeable future.So while people in Oregon can have hope that the future will be financially brighter, people in Alabama are struck and that s why it doesn t make sense for people to vote for Republicans.

At this point, the festivities surrounding the inauguration of the United States  next Grand Wizard, Donald Trump, are shaping up to be a complete disaster that will be referenced in every non-Texas history book for generations to come.A minority of Americans and a broken system with a special helping hand from Vladimir Putin and James Comey may have barely  elected  Donald Trump President, but he remains the least popular person to step into the Oval Office since Osama bin Hitler took office in 1897 in an alternate timeline (that s right, we had to reach outside reality to find something to which we could compare Trump s  yuge  level of unpopularity).Trump may be bragging about the  record-setting turnout  he is expecting, but the truth is that he is crying on the inside. Officials are expecting 800,000 to 900,000 people to show up to see Trump being sworn in as our next President. On their own these numbers may seem impressive, but Obama s inauguration attracted double that   a whopping 1.8 million people showed up for him and as we all know, Trump desperately needs to feel like he has beaten Barack Obama at everything.Trump is so desperate that he has taken the rather interesting approach: shamelessly spending money to beg Americans to show up and adore him   well, people over the age of 27 who live in New York, anyway.

Ticket scalpers are losing money on tickets to the event, which promises to be exactly as exciting as the average county fair (with matching entertainment). Trump has managed to snag obsolete one hit wonder pop band Three Doors Down and country artist who is known for showing up to concerts so drunk that he forgets the lyrics to his own songs. Other performances include a 16-year-old reality show contestant, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, a marching band from  Louisiana s most racist high school,  and whichever of the Rockettes decides to show up to this abortion of an event. Basically, if  I just got my Klan robes back from the drycleaner  is not a part of your vernacular, you re gonna have a bad time at this thing.Recently, Trump hate-tweeted the majority of Americans who are not OK with Russia hacking his political opponents on his behalf, calling them  stupid people  and  fools.

Democratic Party representative Rhee Cheol-hee said 235 gigabytes of military documents were taken from the Defense Integrated Data Center in September last year, citing information from unidentified South Korean defense officials. An investigative team inside the defense ministry announced in May the hack had been carried out by North Korea, but did not disclose what kind of information had been taken. Pyongyang has denied responsibility in its state media for the cyber attacks, criticizing Seoul for  fabricating  claims about online attacks. Separately on Wednesday, cyber security firm FireEye said in a statement North Korea-affiliated agents were detected attempting to phish U.S. electric companies through emails sent in mid-September, although those attempts did not lead to a disruption in the power supply. It did not specify when the attempts had been detected or clarify which companies had been affected. Rhee, currently a member of the National Assembly s committee for national defense, said about 80 percent of the hacked data had not yet been identified, but that none of the information was expected to have compromised the South Korean military because it was not top classified intelligence. Some of the hacked data addressed how to identify movements of members of the North Korean leadership, how to seal off their hiding locations, and attack from the air before eliminating them. Rhee said the North could not have taken the entire operation plans from the database because they had not been uploaded in full. These plans had likely not been classified properly but defense ministry officials told Rhee the hacked documents were not of top importance, he said.  Whatever the North Koreans took, we just need to fix the plans,  Rhee later told Reuters by telephone.  I disclosed this because the military hasn t been doing that fast enough.  Rhee said on radio the hack had been made possible by  a simple mistake  after a connector jack linking the military s intranet to the internet had not been eliminated after maintenance work had been done on the system.  The South Korean Defense Ministry s official stance is that they cannot confirm anything the lawmaker said about the hacked content due to the sensitivity of the matter.     In Washington, the Pentagon said it was aware of the media reports but would not comment on the potential breach.  Although I will not comment on intelligence matters or specific incidents related to cyber intrusion, I can assure you that we are confident in the security of our operations plans and our ability to deal with any threat from North Korea,  Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning told reporters. FireEye said the phishing attack on the electric companies detected was  early-stage reconnaissance  and did not indicate North Korea was about to stage an  imminent, disruptive  cyber attack. The North has been suspected of carrying out similar cyber attacks on South Korean electric utilities, in addition to other government and financial institutions. Those attempts were likely aimed at creating a means of  deterring potential war or sowing disorder during a time of armed conflict , FireEye said.  North Korea linked hackers are among the most prolific nation-state threats, targeting not only the U.S. and South Korea but the global financial system and nations worldwide,  its statement said.  Their motivations vary from economic enrichment to traditional espionage to sabotage, but all share the hallmark of an ascendant cyber power willing to violate international norms with little regard for potential blowback,  it said. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"class\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

 argentina  reuters    the argentine navy raised the possibility on thursday that a navy submarine missing in the south atlantic suffered an explosion  heightening concerns over the fate of the  crew members on the eighth day of an international search effort  a sound detected underwater by an international agency on the morning of nov    around the time the ara san juan sent its last signal and in the same area  was  consistent with an explosion   navy spokesman enrique balbi told reporters  the sub had only a seven day supply of oxygen  a fact that drained hope from some of the relatives of the crew who have gathered at the vessel s base in the city of mar del plata   what s the point of hope if it s already over   itati leguizamon  wife of one of the missing crew members  told reporters   the navy did not have enough information to say what the cause of the explosion could have been or whether the vessel might have been attacked  balbi said  search and rescue crews were undeterred by a series of false leads that raised hope over recent days that the sub might be located  asked during an evening news conference about the fate of the  sailors  balbi said the situation was  critical    we are not going to enter into conjecture out of respect for the families   he added  the information about the possible explosion was received  on thursday from the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty organization  or ctbto  an international body that runs a global network of listening posts designed to check for secret atomic blasts  the vienna based agency  which has monitoring stations equipped with devices including underwater microphones that scan the oceans for sound waves  said in a statement that two of its  stations had detected an unusual signal near where the submarine went missing  the agency was more guarded about whether that  was caused by an explosion  a huge sea and air hunt is being conducted for the san juan  a german built  diesel electric powered submarine that was launched in   as crew members  relatives waited anxiously for news more than a week after the vessel disappeared  the relatives had been largely optimistic until thursday  they shed tears and insulted authorities after being briefed on the news of the possible explosion  they were told about it before the public announcement  balbi said the news of the abnormal sound was consistent with a separate report received on wednesday of an  acoustic anomaly  in the same area and around the same time  the san juan was some  km   miles  off the patagonian coast when it sent its last signal   this is very important because it allows us to correlate and confirm the acoustic anomaly from the u s  report yesterday   balbi said   here  we re talking about a singular  short  violent  non nuclear event  consistent with an explosion   in vienna  ctbto hydroacoustic engineer mario zampolli said the signal his agency had detected  could be consistent with an explosion but there is no certainty about this   speaking to reuters  he agreed with balbi s description of the signal as unusual and short  adding that the cause was non natural  the submarine was en route from ushuaia  the southernmost city in the world  to mar del plata   km   miles  south of buenos aires  when it reported an electrical malfunction shortly before disappearing  some relatives have questioned authorities for letting the crew navigate on an ageing submarine   criticism that has highlighted the armed forces  dwindling resources since the end of a military dictatorship in the    authorities have said the level of maintenance  not the age  was what mattered  and that the vessel was in good condition   \",\n          \" reuters    u s  president donald trump s nominee to head the agriculture department
